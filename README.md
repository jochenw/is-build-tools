# IS Build Tools

This project provides the IS Build Tools: A collection of tools, and utilities
for building an IS project. IS is the [webMethods Integration Server](https://www.softwareag.com/en_corporate/platform/integration-apis/webmethods-integration.html), a powerful ESB server by [Software AG](https://www.softwareag.com).

The IS Build Tools can be used within Jenkins, or a similar build server. However,
for less sophisticated projects, a standalone use (outside any build server) is
supported, too.
